# RE&CT

![](images/logo_v2.png)

The RE&CT Framework is designed for accumulating, describing and categorizing actionable Incident Response techniques.  

RE&CT's philosophy is based on the [MITRE's ATT&CK](https://attack.mitre.org/) framework.  
The columns represent [Response Stages](responsestages.md).  
The cells repsresent [Response Actions](#response-action).  

The main use cases are:

- Prioritization of Incident Response capabilities development, including skills development, technical measures acquisition/deployment, internal procedures development, etc
- Gap analysis â€” determine "coverage" of existing Incident Response capabilities

The main resources:

- RE&CT [website](https://atc-project.github.io/atc-react/) is the best place for getting details about existing analytics  
- [RE&CT Navigator](https://atc-project.github.io/react-navigator/) (modified [ATT&CK Navigator](https://github.com/mitre-attack/attack-navigator)) for visualization and observing the big picture

Response Actions marked by "*" sign are just placeholders, listed to define the way RE&CT will grow.  
The links lead to GitHub issues, that you can use to contribute your analytics.

## Actionable Analytics

The ATC RE&CT project inherits the "Actionable Analytics" paradigm from the [ATC](https://github.com/atc-project/atomic-threat-coverage) project, which means that the analytics are:

- **human-readable** (`.md`) for sharing/using in operations
- **machine-readable** (`.yml`) for automatic processing/integrations
- **executable** by Incident Response Platform ([TheHive Case Templates](thehive_templates/) only, at the moment)

Simply saying, the analytics are stored in `.yml` files, that are automatically converted to `.md` documents (with [jinja](https://palletsprojects.com/p/jinja/)) and `.json` TheHive Case Templates.  
For information about customization and usage, please refer to the [usage](https://github.com/atc-project/atc-react#usage) section of the project README.  

### Response Action

Response Action is a description of a specific atomic procedure/task that has to be executed during the Incident Response. It is an initial entity that is used to construct Response Playbooks. 

Each Response Action mapped to a specific [Response Stage](responsestages.md).  
The first digit of the Response Action ID reflects a Stage it belongs to:

- **1**: Preparation
- **2**: Identification
- **3**: Containment
- **4**: Eradication
- **5**: Recovery
- **6**: Lessons Learned

The second digit of the Response Action ID reflects a Category it belongs to:

- **0**: General
- **1**: Network
- **2**: Email
- **3**: File
- **4**: Process
- **5**: Configuration
- **6**: Identity

This way, using Response Action ID, you can see the Stage and Category it belongs to.  
For example, [RA**22**02: Collect an email message](Response_Actions/RA_2202_collect_email_message.md) is related to Stage **2** (Identification) and Category **2** (Email).

The categorization aims to improve Incident Response process maturity assessment and roadmap development.

### Response Playbook

Response Playbook is an Incident Response plan, that represents a complete list of procedures/tasks (Response Actions) that has to be executed to respond to a specific threat with optional mapping to the [MITRE's ATT&CK](https://attack.mitre.org/) or [Misinfosec's  AMITT](https://github.com/misinfosecproject/amitt_framework) frameworks.

Response Playbook could include a description of the workflow, specific conditions/requirements, details on the order of Response Actions execution, or any other relevant information.

### TheHive Case Templates

are built on top of the Response Playbooks. Each task in a Case Template is a Response Action (with full description). 

Here is the example of an imported TheHive Case Template:

  <summary>One of the Tasks in TheHive Case, made on top of a Response Action (click to expand)</summary>

</details>

TheHive Case Templates could be found in `docs/thehive_templates` directory and could be imported to TheHive via its web interface.
