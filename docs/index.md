# RE&CT

![](images/logo_v2.png)

The RE&CT Framework is designed for accumulating, describing and categorizing actionable Incident Response techniques.  

RE&CT's philosophy is based on the [MITRE's ATT&CK](https://attack.mitre.org/) framework.  
The columns represent [Incident Response stages](responsestages.md).  
The cells repsresent [Response Actions](#response-action).  

The main use cases are:

- Prioritization of Incident Response capabilities development
- Gap analysis â€” determine "coverage" of a set of Incident Response capabilities

The main resources:

- RE&CT [website](https://atc-project.github.io/atc-react/) is the best place for getting details about existing analytics  
- [RE&CT Navigator](https://atc-project.github.io/react-navigator/) (modified [ATT&CK Navigator](https://github.com/mitre-attack/attack-navigator)) for observing the big picture

Response Actions marked by "*" sign are just placeholders, listed to define the way RE&CT will grow.  
The links lead to GitHub issues, that you can use to contribute your analytics.

## Actionable Playbooks

The ATC RE&CT project inherits the "Actionable Analytics" paradigm from the [ATC](https://github.com/atc-project/atomic-threat-coverage) project, which means that the analytics are:

- **human-readable** (`.md`) for sharing/using in operations
- **machine-readable** (`.yml`) for automatic processing/integrations
- **executable** by Incident Response Platform ([TheHive Case Templates](thehive_templates/) only, at the moment)

Simply saying, the analytics are stored in `.yml` files, that are automatically converted to `.md` documents (with [jinja](https://palletsprojects.com/p/jinja/)) and `.json` TheHive Case Templates.  
For information about customization and usage, please refer to the [usage](https://github.com/atc-project/atc-react#usage) section of the project README.  

### Response Action

is a description of a specific atomic procedure/task that has to be executed during the Incident Response. It is an initial entity that is used to construct Response Playbooks. 

Each Response Action mapped to a specific [Incident Response stage](responsestages.md).  
The first digit of the Response Action ID reflects a stage number.  
The second digit of the Response Action ID reflects a category it belongs to:

1. General
2. Network
3. Email
4. File
5. Process
6. Configuration
7. Identity

This way, using Response Action ID, you can see the Stage and Category it belongs to.  
For example, [RA**23**02: Get original email](./Response_Actions/RA_2302_get_original_email.md) is related to Stage **2** (Identification) and Category **3** (Email).

The categorization aims to improve Incident Response process maturity assessment and roadmap development.

### Response Playbook

is an Incident Response plan, that represents a complete list of procedures/tasks (Response Actions) that has to be executed to respond to a specific threat with optional mapping to the [MITRE's ATT&CK](https://attack.mitre.org/) or [Misinfosec's  AMITT](https://github.com/misinfosecproject/amitt_framework) frameworks.

Response Playbook could include a description of the workflow, specific conditions/requirements or details on the order of Response Actions execution.

### TheHive Case Templates

are built on top of the Response Playbooks. Each task in a Case Template is a Response Action (with full description). 

Here is the example of an imported TheHive Case Template:

TheHive Case Templates could be found in `docs/thehive_templates` directory and could be imported to TheHive via its web interface.
