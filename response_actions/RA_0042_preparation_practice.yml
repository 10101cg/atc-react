  Make sure that each and every Response Action has been performed on an internal practice exercise by your Incident Response team. 
  You need to make sure that when an Incident will happen, specialists will not just try to follow the playbooks they see first time in their lives, but will be able to do the actual steps in **your environment**, like blocking an IP or domain. 
  It will not happen without practice.
