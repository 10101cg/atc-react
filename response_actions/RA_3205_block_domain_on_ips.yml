  Block a domain on an IPS using its native filtering functionality.  
  Warning:  
  
  - If not all corporate hosts access the internet through the IPS, you will **not** be able to contain the threat using this Response Action.  
  - Be careful blocking domain names. Make sure it's not a cloud provider or a hoster. If you would like to block something that is hosted on a well-known cloud provider or on a big hoster domain, you should block a specific URL using alternative Response Action.
