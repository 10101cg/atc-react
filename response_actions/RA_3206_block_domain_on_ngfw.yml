  Block a domain name on a NGFW using its native filtering functionality.  
  
  Warning:  
  
  - Be careful blocking domain names. Make sure it's not a cloud provider or a hoster. If you would like to block something that is hosted on a well-known cloud provider or on a big hoster domain, you should (if applicable) block a specific URL using alternative Response Action
