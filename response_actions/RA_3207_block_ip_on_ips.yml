  Block an IP address on an IPS using its native filtering functionality.  

  Warning:  
  
  - Be careful blocking IP addresses. Make sure it's not a cloud provider or a hoster. If you would like to block something that is hosted on a well-known cloud provider or on a big hoster IP address, you should (if applicable) block a specific URL using alternative Response Action
