  Block an IP address on a NGFW using its native filtering functionality.  
  
  Warning:  

  - Be careful blocking IP address. Make sure it's not a cloud provider or a hoster. If you would like to block something that is hosted on a well-known cloud provider or on a big hoster IP address, you should (if applicable) block a specific URL using alternative Response Action
