workflow: |
  The Lessons Learned phase evaluates the team's performance through each step. 
  The goal of the phase is to discover how to improve the incident response process.  
  Basically, you need to answer some basic questions, using the incident report:  

  - What happened?  
  - What did we do well?  
  - What could we have done better?  
  - What will we do differently next time?  

  Keep in mind that the incident report is the key.  
  For example, if Time To Respond is too long, it was caused by some problem.  
  The only way to solve it is to bring it up and start working on it.
