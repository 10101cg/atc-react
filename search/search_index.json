The links lead to GitHub issues, that you can use to contribute your analytics. Actionable Playbooks The ATC RE&CT project inherits the \"Actionable Analytics\" paradigm from the ATC project, which means that the analytics are: human-readable ( .md ) for sharing/using in operations machine-readable ( .yml ) for automatic processing/integrations executable by Incident Response Platform ( TheHive Case Templates only, at the moment) Simply saying, the analytics are stored in .yml files, that are automatically converted to .md documents (with jinja ) and .json TheHive Case Templates. For information about customization and usage, please refer to the usage section of the project README. Response Action is a description of a specific atomic procedure/task that has to be executed during the Incident Response. It is an initial entity that is used to construct Response Playbooks. Each Response Action mapped to a specific Incident Response stage . The first digit of the Response Action ID reflects a stage number. The second digit of the Response Action ID reflects a category it belongs to: 0 : General 1 : Network 2 : Email 3 : File 4 : Process 5 : Configuration 6 : Identity This way, using Response Action ID, you can see the Stage and Category it belongs to. For example, RA 22 02: Get original email is related to Stage 2 (Identification) and Category 2 (Email). The categorization aims to improve Incident Response process maturity assessment and roadmap development. Response Playbook is an Incident Response plan, that represents a complete list of procedures/tasks (Response Actions) that has to be executed to respond to a specific threat with optional mapping to the MITRE's ATT&CK or Misinfosec's AMITT frameworks. Response Playbook could include a description of the workflow, specific conditions/requirements or details on the order of Response Actions execution. TheHive Case Templates are built on top of the Response Playbooks. Each task in a Case Template is a Response Action (with full description). Here is the example of an imported TheHive Case Template: Imported TheHive Case Template, made on top of a Response Playbook (click to expand) One of the Tasks in TheHive Case, made on top of a Response Action (click to expand) TheHive Case Templates could be found in docs/thehive_templates directory and could be imported to TheHive via its web interface.

You need to make sure that when an Incident will happen, the team will not just try to follow the playbooks they see first time in their lives, but will be able to quickly execute the actual steps in your environment , i.e. blocking an IP address or a domain name.

Here are some relevant training courses that will help you in the Incident Response activities: Investigation Theory by Chris Sanders. We recommend you to have it as a mandatory training for every member of your Incident Response team Offensive Security trainings. We recommend PWK to begin with SANS Digital Forensics & Incident Response trainings Offensive Security trainings are in the list because to fight a threat, you need to understand their motivation, tactics, and techniques. At the same time, we assume that you already have a strong technical background in fundamental disciplines \u2014 Networking, Operating Systems, and Programming.

Make sure that an email message is a phishing attack Check an email and its metadata for evidences of phishing attack: Impersonalisation attempts : sender is trying to identify himself as somebody he is not Suspicious askings or offers : download \"invoice\", click on link with something important etc Psychological manipulations : invoking a sense of urgency or fear is a common phishing tactic Spelling mistakes : legitimate messages usually don't have spelling mistakes or poor grammar Explore references of the article to make yourself familiar with phishing attacks history and examples. Extract observables from an email message Extract the data for further response steps: attachments (using munpack tool: munpack email.eml ) from, to, cc subject of the email received servers path list of URLs from the text content of the mail body and attachments This Response Action could be automated with TheHive EmlParser . Containment Block an external IP address from being accessed by corporate assets Block an external IP address from being accessed by corporate assets, using the most efficient way. Warning: Be careful blocking IP addresses. Make sure it's not a cloud provider or a hoster. If you would like to block something that is hosted on a well-known cloud provider or on a big hoster IP address, you should block (if applicable) a specific URL using alternative Response Action Block an external domain name from being accessed by corporate assets Block an external domain name from being accessed by corporate assets, using the most efficient way. Warning: Be careful blocking doman names. Make sure it's not a cloud provider or a hoster. If you would like to block something that is hosted on a well-known cloud provider or on a big hoster doman, you should block (if applicable) a specific URL using alternative Response Action Block an external URL from being accessed by corporate assets Block an external URL from being accessed by corporate assets, using the most efficient way.

Delete an email message from an Email Server and users' email boxes Delete an email message from an Email Server and users' email boxes using its native functionality. Revoke authentication credentials On this step, you supposed to know what kind of credentials have been compromised/you would like to revoke. You need to revoke them in your Identity and Access Management system where they were created (i.e. Windows AD) using native functionality. Warning: If the adversary has generated Golden Ticket in Windows Domain/forest, you have to revoke KRBTGT Account password twice for each domain in a forest and proceed to monitor malicious activity for next 20 minutes (Domain Controller KDC service doesn\u2019t perform validate the user account until the TGT is older than 20 minutes old) Lessons learned Develop the incident report Develop the Incident Report using your corporate template. It should include: Executive Summary with a short description of damage, actions taken, root cause, and key metrics (Time To Detect, Time To Respond, Time To Recover etc) Detailed timeline of adversary actions mapped to ATT&CK tactics (you can use the Kill Chain , but most probably most of the actions will be in Actions On Objective stage, which is not very representative and useful) Detailed timeline of actions taken by Incident Response Team Root Cause Analysis and Recommendations for improvements based on its conclusion List of specialists involved in Incident Response with their roles Conduct Lessons Learned exercise The Lessons Learned phase evaluates the team's performance through each step. The goal of the phase is to discover how to improve the incident response process. You need to answer some basic questions, using developed incident report: What happened? What did we do well? What could we have done better? What will we do differently next time?
