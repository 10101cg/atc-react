The links lead to GitHub issues, that you can use to contribute your analytics. Actionable Playbooks The ATC RE&CT project inherits the \"Actionable Analytics\" paradigm from the ATC project, which means that the analytics are: human-readable ( .md ) for sharing/using in operations machine-readable ( .yml ) for automatic processing/integrations executable by Incident Response Platform ( TheHive Case Templates only, at the moment) Simply saying, the analytics are stored in .yml files, that are automatically converted to .md documents (with jinja ) and .json TheHive Case Templates. For information about customization and usage, please refer to the usage section of the project README. Response Action is a description of a specific atomic procedure/task that has to be executed during the Incident Response. It is an initial entity that is used to construct Response Playbooks. Each Response Action mapped to a specific Incident Response stage . The first digit of the Response Action ID reflects a stage number. The second digit of the Response Action ID reflects a category it belongs to: General Network Email File Process Configuration Identity This way, using Response Action ID, you can see the Stage and Category it belongs to. For example, RA 23 02: Get original email is related to Stage 2 (Identification) and Category 3 (Email). The categorization aims to improve Incident Response process maturity assessment and roadmap development. Response Playbook is an Incident Response plan, that represents a complete list of procedures/tasks (Response Actions) that has to be executed to respond to a specific threat with optional mapping to the MITRE's ATT&CK or Misinfosec's AMITT frameworks. Response Playbook could include a description of the workflow, specific conditions/requirements or details on the order of Response Actions execution. TheHive Case Templates are built on top of the Response Playbooks. Each task in a Case Template is a Response Action (with full description). Here is the example of an imported TheHive Case Template: Imported TheHive Case Template, made on top of a Response Playbook (click to expand) One of the Tasks in TheHive Case, made on top of a Response Action (click to expand) TheHive Case Templates could be found in docs/thehive_templates directory and could be imported to TheHive via its web interface.
